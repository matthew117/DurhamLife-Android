Bugs

- Orientation change messes things up
- Need to update user to fix list
- Unsubcribe button might still be funky (check on mobile phone rather than tablet)
- No syncing to database for societies or pinned events
- Review box only seems to submit the last paragraph of a review and ignore any previous paragraphs
- A time instance is added to google calendar even if you press back (out of our control?)
